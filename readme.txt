[sLaNGjIs team do not providing support on wordpress.org forum and reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/global-admin-bar-hide-or-remove/other_notes/) because we are not interested in reviews o stars on our plugins!

Dear user of plugins or themes:

sLaNGjIs Team has started adventure on WordPress.org forum 8 years ago since 2007!

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the WordPress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable "requests" and those definable "trash" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

The problems of this type of assistance, through that instruments, have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.

Our team has tried to respond to all for more long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean.

Failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since July 7, 2007 to try to give one type of personalized targeted service to user requests.

1. Bug's [sLaNGjIs GitHub](https://github.com/slangji/)
1. Suggestions [sLaNGjIs Contact](https://slangji.wordpress.com/contact/)
1. Support [sLaNGjIs Premium](https://slangji.wordpress.com/premium-support/)

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews on our plugins or themes.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars on our plugins or themes.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Possibility that some of us then reply or write on it, will be very low!
